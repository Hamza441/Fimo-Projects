         <h1> Foundation for Immigrant and Minority Opportunities (FIMO)</h1>
         <p>
             Vision:
             FIMO envisions a future where every child, regardless of their background, has the opportunity<br>
             to excel in their education and in life, becoming active, engaged members of their community.<br>
             We aim to provide comprehensive support from kindergarten through college,<br>
             including homework assistance, enriching activities, inspiring field trips, invigorating<br>
             hiking experiences, and unwavering youth support. Our commitment extends to empowering<br>
             immigrant and minority communities by facilitating their path to U.S. citizenship, aiding in<br>
             job applications, simplifying the tax return process, and coaching and mentoring on college life<br>
             and success.
